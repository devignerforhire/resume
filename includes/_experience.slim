				p Myself and former colleague Andrew Neale setup NuVue Trading while living in the UK. One of our first projects was an e-commerce site, drop-shipping wholesale label clothing to retailers selling on eBay. 
				p After two years of living in the UK, my visa ran out, so we moved the business on to the road, backpacking across South America for two years. 
				p After getting frequent requests for web design work, we branched out and created  Nomad Studios, which later became our primary focus. It was around this time that started getting actively involved in the open-source community.

				p Working at RPC was my first taste of startup life. I was recruited with seven other trainees and put through a rigorous six month bootcamp, then three months of Oracle training in Zimbabwe and later an advanced web design course at UCT.
				p My responsibilities included building technical demos, prototypes, assisting the sales team on client meetings and giving technical presentations at relevant tech shows. I was also responsible for the companies internal portal and website. I will always be incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity, as it gave me the confidence to go out and start a company of my own.
