	p My full name is Christopher Nicholas Rault, but good â€˜ol Chris will do fine.
	p I am a designer and front-end developer, based in the picturesque city of Cape Town, South Africa.
	p I have been building stuff for the web for fifteen years and continue to hone my craft to stay current within the every changing landscape of the web. I am a problem solver at heart and love a new challenge.
