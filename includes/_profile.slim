		p My full name is Christopher Nicholas Rault, but good â€˜ol <em class="p-nickname">Chris</em> will do fine. I am a designer and front-end developer and entreprenuer. I am currently based in the picturesque city of Cape Town, South Africa.
		p Despite having worked on the web for the past fifteen years, I still wake up every morning excited about the days work ahead. I don't think there are many jobs that give you the same satisfaction, as with working on the ever changing landscape that is the web.
