			div#tool-sketch.lightbox
				h3.h4 Sketch
				p Sketch is a vector based design app, exclusively available on the mac. It entered the market at the perfect time, just as Adobe killed off Fireworks.
				h4.h3 How I use it
				p I pretty much have Sketch open 24/7 and will jump in and out of the app as neeed. I've pretty much used Sketch exclusively for the past four years and it's served my needs nicely.

			a href="#" data-featherlight="#tool-atom" title="Open Source Code Editor by Github" Atom
			div#tool-atom.lightbox
				h3.h4 Atom
				p Atom is Githubs open-source code editor, built using web technologies. I was a long time SublimeText 2 user, but made the switch to Atom after development on Submlime came to standstill.
				h4.h3 How I use it
				p Whether I'm implementing a new theme, working on one of my personal projects or a client site, if there is code involved, it's almost certain that I'll have written it in Atom.

			a href="#" data-featherlight="#tool-wordpress" title="The leading open-source content management system" WordPress
			div#tool-wordpress.lightbox
				h3.h4 WordPress
				p I've been using WordPress on and off for over ten years and pretty much full time for the past five years. What I love most about WordPress is the consistent release cycle and constant refinements. It's my go to CMS when static doesn't make sense.
				h4.h3 How I use it
				p Most of the sites in my network are built with WordPress and I often use it to build client sites. I have to multisite installs that I use for theme demos on ThemeButler and template and plugin demos on HeadwayRocket.

			a href="#" data-featherlight="#tool-beans" title="GPL WordPress theme framework focussed on performance" Beans
			div#tool-beans.lightbox
				h3.h4 Beans
				p Beans started off as the internal framework to power the themes we were building for ThemeButler. It has since then matured into a rock-solid framework that lets you build quickly and efficiently. It has a strong emphasis on performance and makes it easy to create tailored solutions for your clients.
				h4.h3 How I use it
				p I use Beans exclusively for all my own WordPress projects and for new clients. I also use it to create the free themes I created for ThemeButler.

			a href="#" data-featherlight="#tool-uikit" title="A modern, modular, front-end framework" UIkit
			div#tool-uikit.lightbox
				h3.h4 UIkit
				p UIkit is a modular front-end framework. It's built by the guys from Yootheme and of all the front-end frameworks I've tried over the years, it just feels right. It's made up of different components, than can be pulled in as needed and each of the components is engineered to the highest standards.
				h4.h3 How I use it
				p UIkit is one of the core modules in Beans, so I've used it pretty extensively in all my personal and client projects. Normally when you download UIkit, all of the base components are included, but in Beans, you have absolute control over which components get loaded when, ensuring you're always only loading whats absolutely needed.

			a href="#" data-featherlight="#tool-hammer" title="Mac app to streamline static development" Hammer
			div#tool-hammer.lightbox
				h3.h4 Hammer
				p Hammer is a mac app, that takes the pain out of static site development. Normally when building static sites, there is a lot of repitition and inefficiencies. Thanks to Hammer, I'm able to take advantage of modern front-end tools to create a super efficient workflow.
				h4.h3 How I use it
				p All my early design concepts start off as static prototypes built with Hammer. It's a great way to test out how an interaction feels, compared to looking at a flat design. I'm also using Hammer to rebuild some of my personal projects, where it makes sense.

			a href="#" data-featherlight="#tool-cockpit" title="Open-source headless content management system" Cockpit
			div#tool-cockpit.lightbox
				h3.h4 Cockpit
				p Cockpit is a relatively new contender to the headlesss CMS crowd. If it's the first you're hearing of headless, it essentially means it's an CMS that takes an API first approach. You still manage your content in a slick dashboard, but from there the content can be used anywhere. Write once, publish everywhere. It's a concept popularlized by Contentful and is gaining traction amongst the development community.
				h4.h3 How I use it
				p I am currently using Cockpit for the HeadwayRocket site and the new version of my portfolio. It has custom content types built-in, so creating your various content types is a breeze and the split-screen content editor is a dream to work with. It even has markdown support out-the-box.

			div#tool-terminal.lightbox
				h3.h4 Terminal
				p It's definitely not the most exciting tool in my toolbox, but an essential one non-the-less. Terminal is Apples command line interface (much like DOS).
				h4.h3 How I use it
				p I mostly use Terminal for general site administration via SSH. Things like backing up files, interacting with MySQL, updating permissions, or setting up local development tools.

				h3.h4 MAMP Pro
				p As the name suggests, MAMP Pro is the paid version of MAMP and takes care of setting up your local development environment. It also makes it easy to change the version of PHP from host to host and automatically creates xip.io links, to preview your work on any device on your network.
